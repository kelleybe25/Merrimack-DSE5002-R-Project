# Merrimack-DSE5002-R-Project
Merrimack College - Master's in Data Science coding project in Rstudio

Assignment Description:
Your CEO has decided that the company needs a full-time data scientist, and possibly a team of them in the future. She thinks she needs someone who can help drive data science within then entire organization and could potentially lead a team in the future. She understands that data scientist salaries vary widely across the world and is unsure what to pay them. To complicate matters, salaries are going up due to the great recession and the market is highly competitive. Your CEO has asked you to prepare an analysis on data science salaries and provide them with a range to be competitive and get top talent. The position can work offshore, but the CEO would like to know what the difference is for a person working in the United States. Your company is currently a small company but is expanding rapidly. 
Prepare your analysis in an R file. Your final product should be a power point presentation giving your recommendation to the CEO. CEOs do not care about your code and donâ€™t want to see it. They want to see visuals and a well thought out analysis. You will need to turn in the power point and the code as a flat R file.
